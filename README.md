# long_read_isoform_visualizer
Simple sashimi-plot like isoform visualizer for long-read sequencing.

## Features
- Plots isoforms from full-length transcripts genereted by long-read sequencer such as ONT MinION and PacBio.
- Plots RNAseq reads densities along exons and splice junctions.
- Plots isoforms transcribed from given Transcript Start Sites (TSSs)
    - Allows multiple TSSs on same figure and can compare isoforms from different TSSs.
- Plots all isoforms in the given regions.

## Requirement

- Python3 (3.7.6) 

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/isihya/long_read_isoform_visualizer.git
